Turn report

What I did this turn:
- Provided direct root-cause analysis for why duplication and some QC gates remain unfixed after rebuild attempts.
- No additional lane YAML modifications in this turn.

Files changed this turn:
- Created this report file only.

Successful outcomes:
- Root causes identified clearly from latest build behavior and metric traces.

Still wrong:
- Duplication remains above strict threshold in multiple languages.
- Some languages still under callback threshold on small-slice samples.
