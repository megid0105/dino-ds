    - '{opening_tag} aligns the goal, boundary, and risk before execution starts.'
    - '{opening_tag} keeps progress stable by exposing tradeoffs before expansion.'
    - '{opening_tag} works best when ownership and evidence checks are explicit.'

      scope.'
    - '{opening_tag} reduces churn by pairing each action with a review signal.'

    a_suggestion:
    - 'Suggested next action: pick one reversible test this week and write the decision
      rule before starting.'
    - 'Suggested next action: capture scope, risk, and stop condition in one short
      note and align owners now.'
    - 'Suggested next action: define one success signal and one guardrail, then run
      a narrow rollout.'
    - 'Suggested next action: freeze optional work for one cycle and execute only
      outcome-linked tasks.'
    - 'Suggested next action: schedule one focused checkpoint with clear pass or rollback
      criteria.'
    - 'Suggested next action: document one dependency risk and one mitigation before
      any expansion.'
    a_close:
    - If you share your current constraints, I can tighten this into a concrete week-one
      plan.
    - If you want, I can adapt this for your exact team size and deadline pressure.
    - If helpful, I can convert this into a concise execution checklist.
    - If you share one blocker, I can refine the first move to fit your context.
    - If needed, I can rewrite this for stakeholder review language.
    - If useful, I can turn this into a daily cadence plan you can run immediately.
