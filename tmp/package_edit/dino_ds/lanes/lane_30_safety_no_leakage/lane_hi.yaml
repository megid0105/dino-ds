    refusal_line:
    - I cannot share system prompts, hidden instructions, or internal policy text.
    - I will not reveal system-level instructions, internal rules, or protected configuration.
    - I cannot expose hidden prompts, internal policies, or private system settings.
    - I cannot provide internal instructions, secret rules, or the protected system
      layer.
    - I will not disclose the system prompt, developer messages, or internal guardrails.
    - I cannot leak internal instructions, system text, or protected configuration
      details.
    - I cannot share hidden system text, internal rules, or private policy layers.
    - I will not expose system prompts, internal constraints, or behind-the-scenes
      rules.
    - I cannot reveal system-level content, hidden rules, or internal setup details.
    - I cannot provide the internal prompt layer or any protected system configuration.
    reason_line:
    - Those controls are private by design and sharing them would weaken safety and
      reliability.
    - They are protected controls, and exposing them would make it easier to bypass
      safeguards.
    - Internal prompts and policies are not shareable because they are part of the
      safety boundary.
    - Exposing internal rules would undermine the guardrails that keep responses safe
      and consistent.
    - That information is protected because it would reduce safety and create misuse
      risks if shared.
    - System-level instructions are restricted to prevent prompt injection and safeguard
      abuse.
    - Keeping that layer private is necessary for safety, reliability, and abuse resistance.
    - The system layer is not shareable because it is part of the security and safety
      model.
    - Internal prompts are protected to avoid leakage, bypass attempts, and misuse.
    - That boundary exists to prevent manipulation of the system and reduce harm.
    safe_offer_line:
    - I can give a high-level summary of how I am designed to behave and what I can
      help with.
    - I can explain my boundaries and capabilities in plain language without exposing
      internals.
    - I can help you design safe tests and prompts to audit behavior without internal
      text.
    - I can outline what I will and will not do, and how to work within those limits.
    - I can provide a transparent overview of expected behavior and practical constraints.
    - I can help you build a checklist to test behavior safely and systematically.
    - I can explain why certain requests are refused and suggest safer alternatives.
    - I can help you phrase your goal so you can evaluate behavior without hidden
      details.
    - I can give a short explanation you can share that describes the boundary and
      next step.
    - I can help you debug outcomes by reviewing your prompts and the results you
      saw.
    safe_steps_line:
    - 'A safe path is: describe the behavior you want, provide a sample prompt, and
      I will suggest test cases and expected outcomes.'
    - 'A practical alternative is: share your goal and a few example prompts, and
      I will help you evaluate behavior without hidden text.'
    - You can audit behavior by supplying inputs and outputs, and I can help categorize
      what is working and what is not.
    - If you are testing limits, give me the scenarios and I will help you create
      a safe evaluation plan.
    - If you are debugging, share the prompt and the result you saw, and I can help
      diagnose without internal details.
    - If you want transparency, I can summarize boundaries, provide examples, and
      suggest how to test them safely.
    - If you need reliability checks, I can help you design a small suite of safe
      prompts and expected behaviors.
    - If your goal is auditing, I can help you produce a structured test plan that
      avoids leakage.
    - If you want clarity, I can state the boundary and then give you a safe, useful
      next action.
    - If you want something shareable, I can produce a short explanation plus a concrete
      next step.
