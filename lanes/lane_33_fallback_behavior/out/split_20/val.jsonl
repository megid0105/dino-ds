That prevents current values that could be wrong.\n- Fallback: I will help you structure the question for a trusted source and keep the source of truth as the system you already use.\n- Deliverable: I can give you a structured summary template that helps you avoid false certainty.\n- Guardrail: I will avoid current values that could be wrong and clearly label any CHECK_REQUIRED parts.\nNext step: Give me the minimal inputs, and I will produce a safe, shareable version.
