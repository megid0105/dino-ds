Do you want a template you can fill with live details?\nUser: Do it. Keep the answer skimmable. Use neutral wording. Tone should be clear."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will keep this honest: no live tool claims, only safe alternatives.\n- Limitation: I cannot retrieve external tools in this session.

I will keep the fallback clear and practical."}]}
