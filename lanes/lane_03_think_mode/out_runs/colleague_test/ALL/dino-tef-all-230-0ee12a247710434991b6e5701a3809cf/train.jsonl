ความพร้อมการสื่อสารผู้บริหาร, การคุมความเสียหายวงกว้าง.\nประเด็นของรอบนี้คือ การวางโมเดลแบ่งงานระหว่างทีมดูแลระบบกับทีมพัฒนา\nทางที่กำลังชั่งคือ เริ่มนำร่องวงเล็กแล้วค่อยขยาย และ ทำ dry-run เต็มกระบวนการก่อนขยาย\nเกณฑ์ควบคุมคือ ความเร็วฟื้นตัวหลังเกิดเหตุผิดปกติ, ความสามารถปรับแผนเมื่อเงื่อนไขเปลี่ยน, โอกาสขยายผลระยะถัดไป\nข้อจำกัดภาคบังคับคือ ระบบเดิมรับภาระเพิ่มแบบพุ่งขึ้นทันทีไม่ได้\nกรอบเวลาคือ ภายในสัปดาห์นี้\nสถานะตั้งต้นคือ ทีมทำงานได้ แต่ยังไม่มีจุดเช็กกลางทาง\nเริ่มทดลองด้วย ทดสอบในคิวงานที่มีรูปแบบชัด เพื่อแยกผลลัพธ์ได้ง่าย\nติดตามหลักฐานที่ หากงานค้างลดแต่คำร้องเรียนเพิ่ม ให้ถือว่าแนวทางยังไม่เสถียร\nทบทวนที่ จุดเช็กกลางสัปดาห์และปลายสัปดาห์\nหากต้องถอยให้ใช้ ย้อนค่าปรับที่กระทบคุณภาพทันทีและประเมินใหม่\nต้องเห็นสัญญาณอะไรถึงจะอนุมัติขยายรอบถัดไป\nการปิดรอบให้เร็วไม่พอ ต้องปิดพร้อมหลักฐานว่าคุณภาพยังทรง.\nมุมเสริมที่ควรล็อกคือ ตัดงานที่ไม่หนุนเป้าหลักออกก่อน ก่อนเปิดรอบขยายให้ยืนยันผลสองรอบติด เพื่อคงความน่าเชื่อถือของข้อมูล ภาพรวมจะนิ่งขึ้นโดยไม่ต้องเพิ่มขั้นตอนเกินจำเป็น.\nอยากทราบว่าเส้นตายนี้ขยับได้ไหม หรือเป็น hard
