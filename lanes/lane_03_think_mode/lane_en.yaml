    a_opening:
      - A durable answer is possible when the scope and risk are framed together.
      - This can move forward cleanly when you tie decisions to explicit constraints.
      - A stable path appears once you connect your goal with the real operating limits.
      - The safest progress comes from sequencing decisions instead of widening scope.
      - You can keep momentum if each move protects both quality and execution focus.
      - This becomes clearer when tradeoffs are named early and reviewed deliberately.
      - A practical direction is to align immediate work with the most fragile constraint.
      - You can reduce noise by choosing one anchor outcome and defending it each cycle.
      - This is manageable when the next move is specific and the review signal is clear.
      - You can avoid churn by pairing scope decisions with explicit risk checks.
      - A coherent plan starts by narrowing attention to what must hold under pressure.
      - You can keep this grounded by linking each action to observable evidence.
      - A resilient decision path relies on small commitments that are easy to validate.
      - This can stay human and practical when clarity comes before expansion.
      - A strong approach is to protect core outcomes while trimming optional complexity.
      - You can move confidently when each choice has a clear reason and a clear check.
      - This becomes easier when the plan is paced to match real capacity.
      - You can protect delivery quality by making tradeoffs explicit up front.

          {a_opening} For {topic_term}, with {constraint_hint} and {timebox}, pursue {desired_outcome} while reducing {risk_hint}. In {scenario_hint}, match execution to {skill_level} and ground decisions in {expert_concept_a} together with {expert_concept_b}. Because {device_hint} and {audience_hint} shape real delivery, pair {expert_concept_c} with {expert_tool_a} so progress stays practical.

          - For {topic_term}, begin by {expert_move_a} so {constraint_hint} does not derail momentum.
          - In {scenario_hint}, use {expert_move_b} to turn {desired_outcome} into visible progress.
          - Keep {topic_term} steady by {expert_move_c} and monitor {expert_check_a}.
          - Protect quality by {expert_move_d}, especially when {risk_hint} starts to grow.
          - Strengthen confidence by {expert_move_e} and verify {expert_check_b}.
          - Avoid {expert_pitfall_a} by anchoring each pass to {expert_concept_a}.
          - Avoid {expert_pitfall_b} by applying {expert_tool_b} before scope expands.
          - Avoid {expert_pitfall_c} and confirm {expert_check_c} before broader rollout.

          {a_opening} Your work on {topic_term} can stay coherent when {constraint_hint} and {risk_hint} are handled as one decision frame across {timebox}. In {scenario_hint}, keep the pace matched to {skill_level} and connect {expert_concept_a} with {expert_concept_c} so tradeoffs remain explicit. Since {audience_hint} relies on clarity and {device_hint} shapes execution friction, use {expert_tool_a} to keep alignment grounded.

          - Keep {topic_term} focused by {expert_move_a} before adding optional scope.
          - Translate {desired_outcome} into action through {expert_move_b}.
          - Use {expert_move_c} to keep direction stable and check {expert_check_a}.

          {a_opening} For {topic_term}, the key is to keep {desired_outcome} tied directly to {constraint_hint} while you guard against {risk_hint} during {timebox}. In {scenario_hint}, shape effort around {skill_level} and combine {expert_concept_b} with {expert_concept_c} so choices stay disciplined. Because {audience_hint} needs predictable delivery through {device_hint}, reinforce decisions with {expert_tool_a} and clear rationale.

          - Start {topic_term} with {expert_move_a} to create a stable baseline.
          - Use {expert_move_b} so the team can see progress toward {desired_outcome}.
          - Anchor consistency through {expert_move_c} and monitor {expert_check_a}.
          - Apply {expert_move_d} when signals point toward {risk_hint}.
          - Keep momentum by {expert_move_e} and review {expert_check_b}.
          - Prevent {expert_pitfall_a} by revisiting {expert_concept_a} during review.
          - Prevent {expert_pitfall_b} by logging decisions in {expert_tool_b}.
          - Prevent {expert_pitfall_c} and verify readiness with {expert_check_c}.

          {a_opening} You will get better outcomes on {topic_term} when {constraint_hint} and {desired_outcome} are evaluated together under the same {timebox}. In {scenario_hint}, keep the approach aligned with {skill_level} and rely on {expert_concept_a} plus {expert_concept_b} to avoid reactive choices. Given {device_hint} constraints and {audience_hint} expectations, use {expert_tool_a} to keep decisions transparent and practical.

          - Move {topic_term} forward by {expert_move_a} before broadening scope.
          - Convert intent into action by {expert_move_b} in the current context.
          - Hold consistency through {expert_move_c} and check {expert_check_a}.

          - Maintain cadence with {expert_move_e} and inspect {expert_check_b}.
          - Minimize {expert_pitfall_a} with reminders tied to {expert_concept_c}.
          - Minimize {expert_pitfall_b} by using {expert_tool_b} as a guardrail.

          {a_opening} A dependable plan for {topic_term} comes from pairing {constraint_hint} with {risk_hint} while keeping attention on {desired_outcome} over {timebox}. In {scenario_hint}, align depth with {skill_level} and center decisions on {expert_concept_b} with {expert_concept_c}. Because {audience_hint} relies on clear expectations and {device_hint} limits throughput, apply {expert_tool_a} to preserve coherence.

          - Ground {topic_term} by {expert_move_a} so priorities stay explicit.
          - Keep motion practical by {expert_move_b} toward {desired_outcome}.
          - Stabilize execution through {expert_move_c} and verify {expert_check_a}.

          {a_opening} For {topic_term}, practical reasoning means linking {desired_outcome} to {constraint_hint} and handling {risk_hint} before expansion within {timebox}. In {scenario_hint}, keep strategy proportional to {skill_level} and combine {expert_concept_a} with {expert_concept_c} for steady choices. Since {audience_hint} and {device_hint} both influence clarity, reinforce decisions through {expert_tool_a}.

          - Advance {topic_term} by {expert_move_a} to establish a controlled starting point.
          - Use {expert_move_b} to connect effort directly with {desired_outcome}.
          - Maintain signal quality by {expert_move_c} and track {expert_check_a}.
          - Address early risk through {expert_move_d} when {risk_hint} appears.
          - Keep adaptation disciplined via {expert_move_e} and inspect {expert_check_b}.
          - Reduce {expert_pitfall_a} by grounding choices in {expert_concept_b}.
          - Reduce {expert_pitfall_b} by documenting tradeoffs with {expert_tool_b}.

          {a_opening} The cleanest route for {topic_term} is to align {constraint_hint} with {desired_outcome} while actively reducing {risk_hint} across {timebox}. In {scenario_hint}, keep execution at a {skill_level} pace and connect {expert_concept_b} with {expert_concept_a} so decisions remain grounded. With {device_hint} realities and {audience_hint} expectations, rely on {expert_tool_a} to preserve context fidelity.

          - Start with {expert_move_a} so {topic_term} has a clear direction.
          - Use {expert_move_b} to make {desired_outcome} concrete.
          - Keep continuity through {expert_move_c} and watch {expert_check_a}.
          - Apply {expert_move_d} to contain {risk_hint} early.
          - Strengthen execution with {expert_move_e} and validate {expert_check_b}.
          - Avoid {expert_pitfall_a} by reinforcing {expert_concept_c} in reviews.
          - Avoid {expert_pitfall_b} by checking assumptions with {expert_tool_b}.
          - Avoid {expert_pitfall_c} and close the loop through {expert_check_c}.

          {a_opening} You can keep {topic_term} stable when {constraint_hint} is treated as a design boundary and {desired_outcome} remains visible through {timebox}. In {scenario_hint}, adapt to {skill_level} and anchor choices in {expert_concept_a} plus {expert_concept_b} rather than reactive urgency. Because {audience_hint} needs consistency and {device_hint} introduces friction, apply {expert_tool_a} to keep decisions transparent.

          - For {topic_term}, begin with {expert_move_a} to set practical intent.
