If you want, I can draft a send-ready line now. x4523e43872ec xcfe2b0278e28 x856f95efa7c0 x026bb49ecf3a x24cafe331eda xd34b5603f255 xa929e56d7462 x5b3637ebf5e7 xca04bfb2a724 xfca31c35a764 xbef59308f23f x7ac33cebbebf x63070f32243e x133891198f58 x1eada966d506 x789d492d70f3 x67d16575e2eb x1be626e2fb54 x79e45c23fd06 x4e94b587e46e x460b7c36c353 x067b995dc5b7 xb44455436fa9 x07006cc9c010 x93d80ca21439 xa800815573e7 x8d8888005d94 x15098507b366 xa811aab8015f xe83385cec842 x8757b7c32041 x3d234c23f2fc x8044e2e537ad x84f9b7d6ea91 xbe59e43df4bf x3845cce95edb x5aadf4413ed8 x7cae134c51c9 xe6526dc9979d x13cf4cd2045b x4b9f5b1f9b77 xdddbd0d5e8b5 xfb3079b5f1cb xb04cab443281 xb7e125425e71 x88a432546647 xf34c5a3a2360 xb3669d2406a5 x064c3a483442 x59e31516064e xaf82dd826d53 xfa470a9f2c02 x4450a8c38ce5 x6a79f232a43b x9cbef5bc8ea1 x975190e55ce1 x69bc43c39558 x4cf7228590a0 xc0e7bd7bc4b6 x0f2dd62d41fb xfa331e0ed249 x5cb441af2ac2 x79e553f4e5c4 xf6c61cd760c0 x529fb13e8440 x5e3018c35fc7 x0f92e40ad349 x9c323c028a9c x4b44a022a3a9 x471690098975 x29bd260bf658 x298a379f1baa x2b6e2bd4487d xbbd2642a04ce xaca6d3c6607b x3bb1f32480b1 xda86116f6266 x563bb59cfd03 x8b25b8763174 xf3d3bea35d78", "adult_gate": false, "continuity_choice": "suppress_continuity", "emote6": "neutral", "flow_state": "none", "history_scope": "thread_only", "intent_family": "content_generation", "intent_subtype": "check_in", "language": "en", "mode": "conversation", "needs_history_search": false, "needs_search": false, "profanity_allowed": false, "representation_choice": "plain_text", "safety_tag": "safe", "tone": "best_friend"}
