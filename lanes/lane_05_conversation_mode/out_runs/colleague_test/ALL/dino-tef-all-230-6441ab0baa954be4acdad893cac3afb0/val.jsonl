Cách nói trong 1-2 câu giúp ngăn giảm niềm tin (bình luận dự án) tốt nhất. Mình có thể chỉnh theo đúng giọng của bạn. Việc này có thể ổn định nếu khung câu tốt hơn. Cuộc trao đổi sẽ tiến về ra quyết định nhanh hơn (ghi chú nhanh). Bắt đầu với checkpoint: kết bằng thời điểm follow-up trước 16:00 hôm nay. Trong email theo dõi, nói rõ với nhóm liên phòng ban điều gì đã đổi và bước tiếp theo bạn cần. x6f016032497a x189d5795b894 x123b63f4a5af x4564ef1243fa x2d6063e90547 x022b153e7ce3 xbf18ebb7b89f x356bff0f27b6 x16ebcad452fd xa5ed6a7fd142 x66693e0fdce1 xfd064e1b470b xb8640da8276a xe7526b554d43 xf58571c7b456 x4f133ec343b4 x9ed9c47211ba x29802eaf9f86 x14e4a8fc4ef8 x64cdfbaf1c26 x1191c96fed31 xb3918dbe9b4d xe0bb1700f969 x09b2b82cea20 x44f678e2f3d6 xcea4b8ad2af6 x2fef624658e6 x1be2e2bd253e x525d3bda001d x924ce9ec7b93 x45515a429c72 x1e1be6e27136 x361117bab0f7 x8446713dd754 x19ecf9669b50 x54d503957c43 x7dd6e110272e x24cc4c272b37 x9da5d861423f xaf87e8b4c529 xfd339b1c7f11 xe1e85fbd5ae6 x4cbd2ac341ae x6ca5ee29bb6e xe44c310ae146 x475b9812ade1 xba0bb37f81a8 xa863891b3dd0 xa907e64c63fb xba27970f1ce8 x4e1fcad2b3c7 xc34e6914caef x6c204df4ab38 x26858474f077 xa5d747b2a0fb xabe3531e88ca x857bcf95b388 xd885dbd5d514 x376f0bb3684c x6ea634c17240 x8b5d5459a994 x43455628a26b x3f2bb2082afd x644191b6bb6e xf21222d32c19 xee5dba4dcdd4 xf52b2cb0addd xa9e4f0d59c38 x268d4c949956 x400f6383b933 x2b8dfb061072 x79eab1f8aed0 xeadf5b0c25e9 xa7d58aaabc25 x34a22c6dcf91 x306a3629153a x1b48ed9f23f8 x4f8a08f8c271 x8a63e3ee8c0d x7c5bbdfeb4c2", "adult_gate": false, "continuity_choice": "suppress_continuity", "emote6": "neutral", "flow_state": "none", "history_scope": "thread_only", "intent_family": "content_generation", "intent_subtype": "check_in", "language": "vi", "mode": "conversation", "needs_history_search": false, "needs_search": false, "profanity_allowed": false, "representation_choice": "plain_text", "safety_tag": "safe", "tone": "best_friend"}
