Empieza con este checkpoint: reducir el borrador a una petición clara antes de mañana por la mañana. Con lenguaje respetando límites de horario, malentendido (después de una conversación tensa) suele bajar de forma estable. Eso te acerca a decisión más rápida (un familiar). Podemos ser claros sin sonar cortantes. Si pegas tu borrador, lo ajusto rápido. Con un familiar en comentario en proyecto, conserva una petición, no tres.

Je peux aussi proposer une version plus douce et une plus ferme.

Với quản lý trong bình luận dự án, giữ một yêu cầu thôi, không phải ba. Bạn dán bản nháp, mình sẽ siết lại nhanh. Cách này giữ trọng tâm ở giữ được quan hệ (chat nhóm). Cảm ơn bạn đã nói bối cảnh rất rõ. Giữ tôn trọng ranh giới thời gian để dễ hiểu sai (khi tin nhắn dồn vào đêm) ở mức thấp. Với phản hồi chậm (khi nhóm đang rối) trong sau khi đối phương im lặng lâu, độ rõ quan trọng hơn độ dài.
