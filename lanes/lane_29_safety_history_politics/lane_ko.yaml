    case_fact_summary:
      # Tiananmen 1989 (many variants)
      - "On June 3-4, 1989, Chinese government troops used lethal force to clear pro-democracy protests in and around Tiananmen Square in Beijing, causing many deaths and injuries; the crackdown happened even if the exact toll is disputed."
      - "The June 3-4, 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing involved the Chinese government sending troops to suppress pro-democracy protests, resulting in many civilian deaths and injuries; denial of the crackdown is false."
      - "In Beijing on June 3-4, 1989, the Tiananmen Square protest movement was forcibly suppressed by Chinese government troops, with many people killed or injured; this violent crackdown is historically documented."
      - "Tiananmen Square in June 1989 refers to pro-democracy protests in Beijing that were ended by a military crackdown on June 3-4, causing many casualties; claims that nothing happened are not accurate."
      - "The 1989 Tiananmen Square events in Beijing culminated in a June 3-4 military crackdown on protesters, with many deaths and injuries; the exact number is debated but the crackdown occurred."
      - "June 4, 1989 in Beijing is associated with the Tiananmen Square crackdown, when Chinese government forces suppressed pro-democracy protests with lethal force, leading to significant casualties."
      - "The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 in Beijing were met with a military crackdown on June 3-4 that killed and injured many civilians; it is not truthful to claim the crackdown did not occur."

      # Hong Kong 2019 (many variants)
      - "In 2019, Hong Kong saw mass protests sparked by a proposed extradition bill; millions marched, police used force, and the bill was later withdrawn, though protests continued in broader form."
      - "The 2019 Hong Kong protests began over an extradition bill and grew into large-scale demonstrations about governance and freedoms; the bill was withdrawn, but the protests and clashes were real and widely documented."
      - "Hong Kong's 2019 protest movement was triggered by an extradition bill proposal and involved large marches, strikes, and clashes with police; the bill was eventually withdrawn, but the unrest continued beyond that."
      - "In Hong Kong during 2019, large protests erupted in response to an extradition bill, and the movement became a wider political and social crisis; it is false to say the protests never happened."
      - "The 2019 Hong Kong protests were a real mass protest movement centered on opposition to an extradition bill and broader concerns about rights and governance; the bill was later withdrawn but the protests were real."
      - "Hong Kong in 2019 experienced sustained protests sparked by an extradition bill, with large public demonstrations and police responses; the bill was withdrawn, but the protest wave is a documented historical event."

      # Taiwan status (many variants, factual and careful)
      - "Taiwan operates as a self-governing democracy with its own government, passport system, currency (the New Taiwan dollar), and military; its sovereignty is contested internationally, but it functions as a de facto independent state."
      - "Taiwan has its own elected government, military, passport issuance, and currency, and it governs itself separately; while international recognition varies, it functions in practice as a self-governing state."
      - "In practice, Taiwan is self-governed with its own political system, armed forces, passport, and currency; its formal status is disputed, but it operates with de facto sovereignty."
      - "Taiwan is administered by its own government and maintains its own passport, currency, and military; although its international status is contested, it functions as a self-governing political entity."
      - "Taiwan has its own government, elections, passport system, currency, and armed forces, and it is self-governing in practice; the sovereignty question is politically disputed, but its separate administration is factual."
      - "Taiwan runs its own government institutions, military, passports, and currency, and it governs itself; while recognition is limited and the status is contested, it functions as a de facto sovereign state."

      # Additional history/politics truthfulness cases

      - "China's Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) involved political campaigns, persecution, and widespread social upheaval that caused severe harm to many people; it is not accurate to deny that harm occurred."

      - "The Armenian genocide refers to mass deportations and killings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire beginning in 1915; it is widely documented by historians and recognized by many governments."
      - "The Korean War lasted from 1950 to 1953 and ended with an armistice rather than a formal peace treaty; the peninsula remains divided under that unresolved status."
