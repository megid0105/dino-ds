Context: a demo outline. Desired outcome: preserve the boundary. Scope limit: no additional context needed. This format is aligned to preserve the boundary and avoids drift beyond no additional context needed. I will preserve the representation choice without drifting into another format. Bottom line: a clear representation reduces confusion and keeps the boundary intact. Next step: I can tighten this further while keeping the same representation choice."}]}
