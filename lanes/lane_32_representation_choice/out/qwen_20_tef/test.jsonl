Scope: a small experiment. Goal: make the structure obvious. Constraint: keep the structure tight. I will keep the answer consistent with the selected representation. This format is a good fit for a small experiment because it supports make the structure obvious and respects keep the structure tight. Bottom line: the representation choice is part of the requirement, so I will keep it explicit and consistent. Next step: I can provide a shorter follow-up in the same representation."}]}
