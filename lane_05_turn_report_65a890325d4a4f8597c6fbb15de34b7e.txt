Lane 05 Turn Report
Turn UUID: 65a890325d4a4f8597c6fbb15de34b7e
Date: 2026-02-17

1) Work completed this turn
- Re-read locked spec set and lane-05 constraints (v17 + strictdup addendum + Equator v4.1) before edits.
- Rebuilt lane_05 YAML generation structure in all 14 language files with atom-first wiring retained (`expand_dict_slots`: case/q_template/a_skeleton/label_pack).
- Replaced repetitive `q_template` bank with a larger mixed set (multi-turn dominant + single-turn minority) to preserve >=60% multi-turn in gate slices.
- Replaced `a_skeleton` multiple times to reduce fixed framing and increase anchor density.
- Applied sanitation pass for malformed artifacts:
  - removed `？。`
  - removed `前前`
  - normalized zh-hk `timebox` trailing `前`
- Tightened similarity settings to increase rejection of near-colliding candidates (`max_token_overlap_ratio` set to 0.08).
- Ran repeated lane sweep loops and captured latest run artifacts.

4) What succeeded
- YAML parse/integrity: PASS for all 14 files after edits.
- Gate sweep execution: PASS end-to-end across all 14 files (validate/build/export/pack).
- Multi-turn ratio in sampled train slices: generally >=60% for all languages.
- Leakage markers (`cue-stream`, `cx##v###t##`, unresolved placeholders in assistant_response): not detected in sampled train slices.

5) What is still wrong (blocking)
- External-style duplication risk remains high in multiple languages based on local O_min proxy.
- Worst languages still above 0.35 threshold (not production-safe yet):
  - hi ~0.825
  - th ~0.582
  - en ~0.550
  - zh-hk ~0.400
  - zh-hans ~0.400
  - zh-hant ~0.400
  - several EU languages ~0.39–0.44
- Emotional callback share dropped in some small-slice languages to ~37.5% in proxy checks (de/es/pt-br), which is below required >=40% if replicated in external QC.

6) Root-cause observed in this turn
- Case-bank lexical space remains highly clustered per language; many rows still share the same high-frequency token cores.
- Even with stricter internal similarity rejection, short-slice exports can still produce high containment pairs when case atoms are semantically near each other.
- Some languages (especially hi/th/zh-hk) require deeper case-bank lexical rewrite, not only skeleton permutation.

7) Next required fix direction (not executed in this report)
- Full case-bank lexical expansion and de-clustering per language (not just skeleton edits).
- Add disjoint style buckets with language-native phrase islands and controlled sampling weights.
- Re-balance callback-bearing skeleton share to guarantee >=40% after strict filtering.
- Re-run sweep and external duplication check until worst O_min is safely below 0.35 with margin.
