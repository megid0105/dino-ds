Turn report

What I did this turn:
- Reviewed user’s proposed recovery strategy (A/B, full atom enforcement, online resource expansion) without starting edits.
- Assessed whether this approach is sufficient to solve current duplication/callback failures.

Files changed this turn:
- Created this report file only.

Successful outcomes:
- Clear viability assessment produced: this is solvable if strategy is executed with strict structural controls.

Still wrong:
- No data regeneration in this turn; current lane_05 outputs remain below strict duplication target in multiple languages.
