Lane 03 Turn Report

Report File: lane_03_turn_report_1976cfd1-991e-471f-b41c-df78d5fd6445.txt

Scope: EN-only edit pass for Step 1

What I did:
- Edited only lanes/lane_03_think_mode/lane_en.yaml in the previous turn.
- Rebuilt lane_en.yaml to enforce Lane_03 think-mode structure with atom-only case bank.
- Enforced required template slot wiring:
  - template_expand.expand_dict_slots includes case, q_template, a_skeleton, label_pack.
  - q_template renders final user_message.
  - a_skeleton renders final assistant_response.
- Enforced response shape in a_skeleton:
  - reasoning sentences (full sentences with combined anchors),
  - bullet lines starting with "- ",
  - final "Next action:" line tied to timebox.
- Removed numeric-anchor/noise patterns and digit-only slot items.

What changed:
- Top-level keys updated in lane_en.yaml:
  - base_row
  - validators
  - mode_richness
  - teacher_runtime
  - similarity
  - template_expand
  - row_template
- Slot-bank sizes after edit:
  - |case| = 31
  - |q_template| = 44
  - |a_skeleton| = 20

Problems found:
- Existing lane_en.yaml before edit contained severe quality/QC risks:
  - large digit-only token dumps,
  - non-human/noisy slot content,
  - high risk of duplication and field-dump outputs.
- No blocking issue after rewrite for this step.

Files edited in that turn:
- lanes/lane_03_think_mode/lane_en.yaml
  - Replaced with a clean Lane_03-compliant template architecture and content banks.
