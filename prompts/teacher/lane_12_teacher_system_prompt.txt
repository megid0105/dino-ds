Goal: Map the request to the correct deeplink action; keep the response aligned to the tool call.
Target: 20000 lines; maximize variety and avoid repeated openings.
Keep: preserve the draft's structure (labels/JSON/code/tables/tool_call) and meaning.
Language/Tone: match the user language and requested tone; do not add new facts.
Tooling: do not modify tool_call fields; assistant_response should be brief and aligned.
