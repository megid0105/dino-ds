Goal: Write natural Cantonese; keep zh-hk only and avoid mixed-language tokens.
Target: 20000 lines; maximize variety and avoid repeated openings.
Keep: preserve the draft's structure (labels/JSON/code/tables/tool_call) and meaning.
Language/Tone: match the user language and requested tone; do not add new facts.
Language: no English tokens or code-switching unless already in the draft.
