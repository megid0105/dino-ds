Turn Report UUID: 61bbcde85fe54d82bbf9b8445c0e15f0
Date: 2026-02-17
Lane: lane_03_think_mode

What I did this turn:
1) Rebuilt high-risk Hindi slot banks in lanes/lane_03_think_mode/lane_hi.yaml under the B-first mechanism.
2) Replaced these banks with native high-diversity content while keeping schema and bank-size contracts stable:
   - q_opening (70)
   - q_followup (70)
   - q_context_wrap (70)
   - bullets_intro (70)
   - clarify_q (70)
   - close_line (70)
   - q_template (240)
   - a_skeleton (240)
   - case_shell (240)
   - atom_shell (240)
3) Repaired a YAML anchor issue introduced during replacement by restoring the anchored row_template block:
   - row_template: &id001 (nested)
   - row_template: *id001 (top-level alias)
4) Ran targeted validation on hi and then full lane sweep:
   - hi gate: generated 10/10 at attempt 29
   - full sweep command: ./scripts/qc_lane_sweep.sh lanes/lane_03_think_mode

Files changed this turn:
- lanes/lane_03_think_mode/lane_hi.yaml
- lane_03_turn_report_61bbcde85fe54d82bbf9b8445c0e15f0.txt

What succeeded:
- hi no longer stalls; generation now reaches 10/10 quickly.
- Full lane_03 sweep completed all 14 languages.
- RUN_UUID produced: 61bbcde85fe54d82bbf9b8445c0e15f0
- Combined ALL/train.jsonl produced successfully.

What is still wrong / risk:
- No fatal sweep break remains in this run.
- Attempt pressure is still relatively highest on vi (attempt 4150 for 10 rows), so vi remains the narrowest safety margin language and should be monitored in larger limits.
